## Step 1: Test Everything Works 🧪

**What we're doing:** Making sure your system actually runs!

**How to do it:**

1. Open your terminal (the black window)
2. Go to your project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/james/Desktop/ASAL_Guardian
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Make sure your API key is set:
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY='your_actual_key_here'
   ```

5. Test the system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**What should happen:**
- You should see messages like "✅ [SYSTEM] Found API Key..."
- The agents should run and show results
- No error messages!

**If something breaks:** Check `QUICK_START.md` for troubleshooting!

## Step 2: Push Code to GitHub 📤

**What we're doing:** Putting your code online so judges can see it!

**How to do it:**

1. Make sure you're in the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/james/Desktop/ASAL_Guardian
   ```

2. Add all your files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Save your work (commit):
   ```bash
   git commit -m "ASAL-Guardian: Multi-agent drought early warning system"
   ```

4. Connect to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/jmsmuigai/ASAL_Guardian.git
   ```

5. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**What should happen:**
- Your code appears on GitHub at https://github.com/jmsmuigai/ASAL_Guardian
- All files are there (main.py, app.py, README.md, etc.)

**If something breaks:**
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub on your computer
- You might need to enter your GitHub username and password (or use a personal access token)

## Step 3: Create Your Video 🎥

**What we're doing:** Making a cool video to show off your project!

**How to do it:**

### Option A: Automated (Easier!)

1. Run the video generation script:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   python generate_video.py
   ```

2. Follow the instructions it gives you
3. It will help you create the video step by step

### Option B: Manual (More Control!)

1. **Record your screen:**
   - Open QuickTime Player (on Mac) or OBS Studio
   - Start recording
   - Run `./run_web.sh` in another terminal
   - Open http://localhost:8080
   - Click "Run Agent Workflow"
   - Stop recording

2. **Add narration:**
   - Use the script from `video_assets/video_script.json`
   - Record yourself reading it (or use text-to-speech)
   - Or use the audio files generated by the script

3. **Combine everything:**
   - Use iMovie (free on Mac) or any video editor
   - Add your screen recording
   - Add narration
   - Add images (if you generated them)
   - Keep it under 3 minutes!

**What your video needs:**
- ✅ Problem Statement (what problem are you solving?)
- ✅ Why Agents? (why use multi-agent systems?)
- ✅ Architecture (how does it work?)
- ✅ Demo (show it working!)
- ✅ The Build (what technologies did you use?)
- ✅ Under 3 minutes total

## Step 5: Prepare Your Writeup 📝

**What we're doing:** Writing about your project so judges understand it!

**You need to write (under 1500 words):**

1. **Problem Statement**
   - What problem are you solving?
   - Why is it important?
   - Example: "Drought response in Garissa County is too slow. Data is collected monthly, but fund mobilization takes weeks..."

2. **Solution**
   - What is ASAL-Guardian?
   - How does it work?
   - Example: "ASAL-Guardian is a multi-agent AI system that monitors drought conditions in real-time..."

3. **Architecture**
   - How are the agents structured?
   - What models do you use?
   - Example: "Three sequential agents: Sentinel (data ingestion), Guardian (analysis), Responder (action)..."

4. **Value**
   - What impact does it have?
   - How does it help?
   - Example: "Reduces response time from weeks to minutes, potentially saving lives..."

**Tip:** Use your README.md as a starting point! It already has most of this information.
